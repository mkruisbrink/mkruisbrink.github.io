## What is the tidyverse?

The tidyverse is a package in R that is - in itself - a collection of individual R packages that all work closely together in the same way (they speak thesame kind of language, if you will). Data import & export, manipulation, exploration and visualisation becomes simpler and more elegant by using new and additional syntax which is more intuitive to and readible for us humans.

>
The tidyverse is an opinionated **[collection of R packages](https://www.tidyverse.org/packages)** designed for data science. All packages share an underlying design philosophy, grammar, and data structures. __www.tidyverse.org__

The tidyverse is a toolkit of functionality that is perfect for data scientists. Working with the tidyverse makes your code more intuitive and easy to read and understand. The tidyverse offers a more elegant way to approach the most common data science problems and is widely used today.

```{r tidyverse, echo=FALSE, out.width = '50%', fig.alt = "tidyverse logo", fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/icons/r-packages/thumbs/tidyverse.png", error = FALSE)
```


### Example set-up

You can install the tidyverse via **`install.packages("tidyverse")`** and you only have to install it once. Lets load the tidyverse and the data we're going to use.

```{r install and load, warning=FALSE, outp}

# installs the package if required
#install.packages("tidyverse")

# loads the tidyverse
library(tidyverse)

```


```{r loading data, warning=FALSE}

# using the starwars dataset
data <- starwars

# for the sake of this introduction we will drop all missing values for now
data <- drop_na(data)

```


## Contents of the tidyverse

We’re going to briefly discuss the core contents of the tidyverse, what you might use these packages for and I’ll provide links to the respective documentation as well. 

>
You will definitely not need to know and understand all of these packages, but I am sure that you will love using the functionality that these packages provide. 

The core tidyverse includes the packages that you’re likely to use in everyday data analyses. As of tidyverse 1.3.0, the following packages are included in the core tidyverse:

```{r ggplot2, echo=FALSE, out.width = '50%', fig.alt = "ggplot2 logo", fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/icons/r-packages/thumbs/ggplot2.png", error = FALSE)
```


### [ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/) (visualization)

`ggplot2` is a system to create beautiful graphics, based on __The Grammar of Graphics__. You provide the data, tell ggplot2 how to map variables to aesthetics, what kind of geometry to use (lines, points, bars etc.), and it takes care of the details. [Go to docs...](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/)

#### ggplot2 examples

A few simple illustrations of how to create graphs with ggplot. There is no code from other packages present. I'll implement more functionality from other packages into the next examples and the plots will get better.

```{r ggplot-examples, warning=FALSE}

# plot the height distribution 
ggplot(data, aes(height)) + 
         geom_density(aes(color = sex))

# plot height of different species
# color by species
ggplot(data, aes(species, height, 
                     color = sex)) + 
  geom_point() +
  coord_flip() +
  labs(title = "height distribution of star wars characters by species",
       x = "species",
       y = "height")
```

```{r dplyr, echo=FALSE, oout.width = '50%', fig.alt = "dplyr logo", fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/icons/r-packages/thumbs/dplyr.png", error = FALSE)
```

### [dplyr](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/) (wrangling)

`dplyr` provides a grammar of data manipulation, providing a consistent set of verbs that solve the most common data manipulation challenges. [Go to docs...](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/)

#### dplyr examples

In the previous examples, we took the entire `data` set as input for `ggplot`. 

>
The pipe
dplyr provides the pipe (`%>%`) operator from magrittr. The `%>%` takes what is on the left hand side and pipes it into the right side as the first argument. You can use the pipe to rewrite multiple operations that you can read left-to-right, top-to-bottom (reading the pipe operator as __“and then”__).

With dplyr you get five key functions that will help you solve most - if not all - of your data manipulation challenges. 

* With `filter()` you can pick observations (rows) based on values.

```{r} 
# normal syntax
filter(data, sex == "male" & homeworld == "Tatooine") 

# tidy syntax with pipe operator
data %>% # take the data... and then...
  filter(sex == "male" & homeworld == "Tatooine")
```

* With `arrange()` you are able to sort rows. If the variable is not numeric, it defaults to alphabetical sorting.

```{r}
data %>% arrange(height) 
```


* With `select()` you can pick variables (columns) by their names. You can specify the variable names or provide the numbers, such as variable 1 through 4: `1:4`.

```{r}
data %>% #and then
  select(name, 
         height, 
         gender, 
         species)
```

```{r}
data %>% #and then
  select(1:4)
```

* With `mutate()` you can create new variables or modify existing ones. Let's say we want to create a `height` to `mass` ratio and we might want to express `height` in meters.

```{r}
data %>% #and then
  select(1:3) %>% #and then
  mutate(ratio = height/mass,
         height = height/100)
```

* With `summarise()` you can obtain a succinct summary of one or more variables. 

```{r}
data %>% 
  group_by(sex) %>% 
  summarise(min_height = min(height),
            avg_height = mean(height),
            max_height = max(height)
          )
```



```{r tidyr, echo=FALSE, out.width = '50%', fig.alt = "tidyr logo", fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/icons/r-packages/thumbs/tidyr.png", error = FALSE)
```

### [tidyr](https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/) (tidying)

`tidyr` provides a set of functions that help you get to tidy data. Tidy data is data with a consistent form: in brief, every variable goes in a column, and every column is a variable. [Go to docs...](https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/)

#### tidyr examples

```{r}
data %>% 
  select(name, films) %>%
  unnest(films) 
```


```{r readr, echo=FALSE, out.width = '50%', fig.alt = "readr logo", fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/icons/r-packages/thumbs/readr.png", error = FALSE)
```

### [readr](https://readr.tidyverse.org/) (read & import)

`readr` provides a fast and friendly way to read rectangular data (like csv, tsv, and fwf). It is designed to flexibly parse many types of data found in the wild, while still cleanly failing when data unexpectedly changes. [Go to docs...](https://readr.tidyverse.org/)

```{r purrr, echo=FALSE, out.width = '50%', fig.alt = "purrr logo", fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/icons/r-packages/thumbs/purrr.png", error = FALSE)
```

### [purrr](https://purrr.tidyverse.org/) (mapping)

`purrr` enhances R’s functional programming (FP) toolkit by providing a complete and consistent set of tools for working with functions and vectors. Once you master the basic concepts, purrr allows you to replace many for loops with code that is easier to write and more expressive. [Go to docs...](https://purrr.tidyverse.org/)

```{r tibble, echo=FALSE, out.width = '50%', fig.alt = "tibble logo", fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/icons/r-packages/thumbs/tibble.png", error = FALSE)
```

### [tibble](https://tibble.tidyverse.org/) (enhanced data frames)

`tibble` is a modern re-imagining of the data frame, keeping what time has proven to be effective, and throwing out what it has not. Tibbles are data.frames that are lazy and surly: they do less and complain more forcing you to confront problems earlier, typically leading to cleaner, more expressive code. [Go to docs...](https://tibble.tidyverse.org/)

```{r stringr, echo=FALSE, out.width = '50%', fig.alt = "stringr logo", fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/icons/r-packages/thumbs/stringr.png", error = FALSE)
```

### [stringr](https://stringr.tidyverse.org/) (strings)

`stringr` provides a cohesive set of functions designed to make working with strings as easy as possible. It is built on top of stringi, which uses the ICU C library to provide fast, correct implementations of common string manipulations. [Go to docs...](https://stringr.tidyverse.org/)

```{r forcats, echo=FALSE, out.width = '50%', fig.alt = "forcats logo", fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/icons/r-packages/thumbs/forcats.png", error = FALSE)
```

### [forcats](https://forcats.tidyverse.org/) (factors)

`forcats` provides a suite of useful tools that solve common problems with factors. R uses factors to handle categorical variables, variables that have a fixed and known set of possible values. [Go to docs...](https://forcats.tidyverse.org/)

## Tidyverse essentials

If you get to know the basics of `ggplot`, `dplyr`, `tidyr` and `readr` you will be well-equiped to approach and tackle most data analysis tasks. Once you become a more advanced user and start to feel that you lack in functionality, the other tidyverse packages will be rather easy to learn swiftly.
