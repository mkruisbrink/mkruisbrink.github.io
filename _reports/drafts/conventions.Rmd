```{r setup, include=FALSE}

library(knitr)

knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
knitr::opts_knit$set(root.dir = rprojroot::find_rstudio_root_file())

# define knitr paths
base.dir <- "~/Developer/mkruisbrink.github.io/"
base.url <- "/"
fig.path <- "assets/rmd/"

# set knitr parameters
opts_knit$set(base.dir = base.dir, base.url = base.url)
opts_chunk$set(fig.path = fig.path)

```

# General conventions

Some of the general conventions I use. Everyone eventually has their own style but there is a broadly accepted general consensus. Implementing conventions from the get-go will drastically increase the cleanliness of your code and make it a lot more accessible and readable for others.

1. Functions are in a code font and followed by parentheses, like `sum()`, or `mean()`.
2. Other R objects (like data or function arguments) are in a code font, without parentheses, like `flights` or `x`.
3. To specify from which package objects and/or packages comes from, weâ€™ll use the package name followed by two colons, like `dplyr::mutate()`, or
`nycflights13::flights`. This is also valid R code.

# How to name your files

## Files

Good file names obviously end in `.R` and are meaningfull or specific. If date is an issue, you could add the date as a prefix.

Good file names:

* `historic-market-price.R`
* `20220621_historic-market-price.R`

Bad file names:

* `2248237download.R`
* `fro_dl24(1).R`

## Identifiers

I learned this the hard way. My R Environment would constantly be cluttered with all kinds of variables for different stages in the analysis.

Never use underscores (_) or hyphens (-) in identifiers. Use lowercase for your variables and seperate words by using the dot (.) character.

* `price.timestamp` or `date.range`.

For functions, use initial capital letters (MyFunction).

* `CreateTable` or `ScrapePage`.

Potential constants are prefixed with the letter `k`.

* `kLightSpeed` or `kGravity`.
