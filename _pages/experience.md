After spending a few years traveling, working, gaming and trying to get clear what I actually wanted to do with my life, I decided to study civil engineering. After working in the industry for a short time, I quickly realised that I much preferred other things in life and went to pursue those. 

## Experience

After graduation, I've been working as an engineer at various well-known reputable international construction/offshore/dredging companies. In addition to that I started my own company while on an internship in Costa Rica at the time. If you [take a look at my resume](/assets/docs/CV_mpkruisbrink.pdf) you can see exactly what I've been up to over the past years. I do need to update that file...
