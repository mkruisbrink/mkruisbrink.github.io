## Maxplaining

>
To Maxplain; *verb*, informal. To enthusiastically explain something as if the listener has been eagerly waiting for the answer their whole life. This term was coined by the legendary Max, who loves nothing more than sharing his knowledge with others. Whether it's the inner workings of a car engine or the proper way to fold a fitted sheet, Max is always ready and willing to lend a helping hand (and a lengthy explanation). So don't be shy, ask Max anything! Just be prepared for a detailed response. ðŸ˜‰

## Home 

I currently live in the vibrant city of Rotterdam with my girlfriend. Rotterdam is a sprawling port-city and the views are absolutely amazing. Rotterdam was bombed in WWII and the historical center was largely destroyed. It is an upcoming city with an intriguing mix of old and new architecture and the river Maas basically cuts the city in half, which creates a lot of room for recreation on watersides and a spacious feeling in general.

"[An Architect (INTJ) is a person with the Introverted, Intuitive, Thinking, and Judging personality traits](https://www.16personalities.com/intj-personality). These thoughtful tacticians love perfecting the details of life, applying creativity and rationality to everything they do. Their inner world is often a private, complex one. Architects, independent to the core, want to shake off other peopleâ€™s expectations and pursue their own ideas." 

My girlfriend and I have two **very** cute Snowshoe cats, both adopted. They talk *a lot*!

## Workstation

My set-up looks something like this, though I've moved my office and some proper cable management went down in the process.

## Experience

After obtaining my civil engineering degree, I've been working as an engineer at various reputable international construction/offshore/dredging companies. In addition to that I initiated [Cryptomanuals, a learning platform for cryptocurrencies](https://www.cryptomanuals.com/) while on an internship in Costa Rica.

In the Netherlands we currently run [Cryptocommunity, a community platform for crypto enthousiasts](https://cryptocommunity.nl/). If you [visit my LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mkruisbrink/), you can see exactly what I've been up to over the past years.

I've traveled to 13 countries and have been living and working in 6 of those for longer periods of time. Australia, New-Zealand, CuraÃ§ao, Kuwait, Costa-Rica being the most intense and amazing adventures, which were all over 5 months long. Australia and New-Zealand added up to a full year.

## Necesito Practicar

I practice Spanish every day... Having spent 6 months in Costa Rica has helped a lot. I try to go to a Spanish speaking country often to practice and improve. The dream would be to make a roadtrip in South America.

## Leisure

I have a huge collection of fantasy books... Not kidding, huge. My favorite writers so far are David Gemmel, Robert Jordan, Robin Hobb and Bernard Cornwell. Don't worry, I also read a lot of none-fantasy stuff too...

I have a motorbike license but stil have to buy one and make that Europe tour. I would probably buy something like a Honda Shadow with Harley Davidson vibes.

## Sports

I try to go scuba-diving whenever I get the chance on a holiday or such. I've obtained all my licenses up to PADI Dive Master from periods abroad in Australia (Great Barrier Reef) and CuraÃ§ao. There is nothing quite like that feeling of floating around in the deep blue nothingness, 30+ meter underneath the surface...

Oh, and we also play tennis but I do not have a cool picture (yet).
