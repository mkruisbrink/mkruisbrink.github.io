## Home 

I currently live in the vibrant city of Rotterdam with my girlfriend. Rotterdam is a sprawling port-city and the views are absolutely amazing.

My girlfriend and I have two **very** cute Snowshoe cats, both adopted. They talk *a lot*!

## Travelling

I've traveled to 13 countries and have been living and working in 6 of those for longer periods of time. Australia, New-Zealand, Curaçao, Kuwait, Costa-Rica being the most intense and amazing adventures, which were all over 5 months long. Australia and New-Zealand added up to a full year.

## Necesito Practicar

I practice Spanish every day... Having spent 6 months in Costa Rica has helped a lot. I try to go to a Spanish speaking country often to practice and improve. The dream would be to make a roadtrip in South America.

## Leisure

I have a huge collection of fantasy books... Not kidding, huge. My favorite writers so far are David Gemmel, Robert Jordan, Robin Hobb and Bernard Cornwell. Don't worry, I also read a lot of none-fantasy stuff too...

I have a motorbike license but stil have to buy one and make that Europe tour. I would probably buy something like a Honda Shadow with Harley Davidson vibes.

## Sports

I try to go scuba-diving whenever I get the chance on a holiday or such. I've obtained all my licenses up to PADI Dive Master from periods abroad in Australia (Great Barrier Reef) and Curaçao. There is nothing quite like that feeling of floating around in the deep blue nothingness, 30+ meter underneath the surface...

Oh, and I also play tennis with my girlfriend but I do not have a cool picture (yet).
