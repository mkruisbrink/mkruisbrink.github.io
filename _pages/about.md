## Maxplaining

>
*To Maxplain; verb, informal. To explain something to someone in a way that suggests that they don’t know; used especially when a Max explains something, or anything at all.*

This term was born when I was caught *explaining* things to people (especially my girlfriend) that were quite obvious... It must be because I'm slightly perfectionistic and even if people (in general) do a good job, I still find room to comment on something. Either super helpful or a slightly annoying, depending on the situation!

"[An Architect (INTJ) is a person with the Introverted, Intuitive, Thinking, and Judging personality traits](https://www.16personalities.com/intj-personality). These thoughtful tacticians love perfecting the details of life, applying creativity and rationality to everything they do. Their inner world is often a private, complex one. Architects, independent to the core, want to shake off other people’s expectations and pursue their own ideas."

## Experience

After obtaining my civil engineering degree, I've been working as an engineer at various well-known reputable international construction/offshore/dredging companies. In addition to that I started my own company while on an internship in Costa Rica at the time. If you [visit my LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mkruisbrink/), you can see exactly what I've been up to over the past years.

## Home 

I currently live in the vibrant city of Rotterdam with my girlfriend. Rotterdam is a sprawling port-city and the views are absolutely amazing. Rotterdam was bombed in WWII and the historical center was largely destroyed. It is an upcoming city with an intriguing mix of old and new architecture and the river Maas basically cuts the city in half, which creates a lot of room for recreation on watersides and a spacious feeling in general.

My girlfriend and I have two **very** cute Snowshoe cats, both adopted. They talk *a lot*!

## Travelling

I've traveled to 13 countries and have been living and working in 6 of those for longer periods of time. Australia, New-Zealand, Curaçao, Kuwait, Costa-Rica being the most intense and amazing adventures, which were all over 5 months long. Australia and New-Zealand added up to a full year.

## Necesito Practicar

I practice Spanish every day... Having spent 6 months in Costa Rica has helped a lot. I try to go to a Spanish speaking country often to practice and improve. The dream would be to make a roadtrip in South America.

## Leisure

I have a huge collection of fantasy books... Not kidding, huge. My favorite writers so far are David Gemmel, Robert Jordan, Robin Hobb and Bernard Cornwell. Don't worry, I also read a lot of none-fantasy stuff too...

I have a motorbike license but stil have to buy one and make that Europe tour. I would probably buy something like a Honda Shadow with Harley Davidson vibes.

## Sports

I try to go scuba-diving whenever I get the chance on a holiday or such. I've obtained all my licenses up to PADI Dive Master from periods abroad in Australia (Great Barrier Reef) and Curaçao. There is nothing quite like that feeling of floating around in the deep blue nothingness, 30+ meter underneath the surface...

Oh, and we also play tennis but I do not have a cool picture (yet).
