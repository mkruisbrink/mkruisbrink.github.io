Ideas regarding cryptocurrency macro investorsâ€™ dashboard:

Goal: to clearly demonstrate growth, adoption, trends etcetera and
create additional clarity, confidence for people that have a long term
mindset but find it difficult with all the noise and lots of focus on
TA.aa

Some ideas that I have and would like to work out include but are
certainly not limited to:

-   The decline and erosion of traditional financial infrastructure
    -   Traditional financial metrics (could use quantmod package with
        FRED data?)
    -   Inflation rates (we use crypto as a hedge)
    -   Purchasing power
-   Cryptocurrency market as a whole compared to financial markets and
    S&P500
-   Interactive Portfolio dashboard included working with candlestick
    data from aggregators such as Nomics.com
    -   I already have a custom google sheet portfolio tracker that I
        use: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_yEMj1vH9O6KTq_uDQuMFmp3dj3gpWEZVW6uwnxGprQ/edit?usp=sharing
-   Summarizing market metrics
    -   Total amount of projects
    -   Active/inactive
    -   Dead coins
-   Ecosystem(s)
    -   Segmentation of market (mcap tiers)
    -   Segmentation of market on ecosystems (chains)
-   Where is the value?
    -   Size of ecosystems in terms of projects & user-base
    -   Volume
-   On-chain data
    -   Throughputs, growth, users, whale indicators
-   Social indicators?
    -   Hype/panic indicators
    -   Heatmaps
    -   Overbought/oversold
-   Creating reproducible analysis .Rmd files as flex dashboards?
-   Additionally, publish to static hosted Jekyll site that shows
    analysis source codes in blog form, cool for transparancy and
    sharing analysis methods and getting feedback?

------------------------------------------------------------------------

In the end, I see it as visual data exploration/science project, some
reconstruction of rather simple and well-known metrics/charts but most
importantly: visualizing the rather boring and abstract information,
both financial and crypto-related.

Making this available on a website, on a dashboard or something else,
open for everything.

What are your thoughts?
