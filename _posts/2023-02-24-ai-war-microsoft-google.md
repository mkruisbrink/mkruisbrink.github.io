## Introduction
The race to dominate the world of AI is heating up, with tech giants Microsoft and Google at the forefront of this battle. Google recently announced the upcoming release of Bard AI to compete with [Microsoft's Chat GPT]({% post_url 2023-01-23-benefits-dangers-chatgpt %}), and Microsoft responded by launching a new version of Bing with Chat GPT built in. Both companies are also competing in the browser space with AI-driven innovations. In this article, we take a closer look at this AI war and explore what it means for the future of technology.

## The Announcements and Reactions
Google's announcement of Bard AI was met with mixed reactions. While some were excited to see a competitor to Chat GPT, others criticized Google for rushing the product and making errors during demos. During a demo in Paris, Bard AI made a mistake that caused the stock price to tank, even though the product hadn't launched yet. Furthermore, the demo couldn't be completed because the presenters forgot their phone that was going to be used to show off one of Bard's features.

The day after the Bard announcement, Microsoft fired back by releasing a new version of Bing with Chat GPT built in to compete with Google's search dominance. While Google currently has a monopoly on search with 93% of all search volumes, Microsoft is aiming to capture some of that market share with this move. Bing searches currently account for only 3% of total search volumes, but the incorporation of Chat GPT could change that.

## The Diversified Microsoft and the Monolithic Google
Microsoft's revenue is highly diversified, which means that Bing is just another product in its portfolio. This diversification allows Microsoft to take risks and ship products faster, as it has less to lose than Google. On the other hand, Google's search engine is its lifeblood. The company has to move slower to maintain its reputation and prevent the loss of its search users, which make up the bulk of its revenue.

## The Browser Wars and AI Integration
In addition to competing in search, Microsoft and Google are also competing in the browser space. Microsoft recently revamped its Edge browser, integrating open AI's technology into it. The browser's new tagline is "your personal co-pilot of the web," and the goal is to create a browsing experience personalized and assisted with AI. This is similar to the vision behind GitHub's Co-Pilot, which uses AI to help developers write code faster.

## The Chess Game Analogy
To explain this AI war, let's use an analogy: it's like a chess game between Microsoft and Google. The kings (Microsoft and Google) have to survive, and their only goal in life is not to die. Both companies move slowly due to their size and resources, and the ultimate goal is to dominate the AI space by creating a personalized and assisted browsing experience with AI. Whoever gets there first wins the AI war.

## Conclusion
The AI war between Microsoft and Google is not just about search or browser dominance, but about who will lead the way in creating the next era of the internet. The company that gets there first will have a significant advantage in the tech industry, and we are seeing that play out with the rapid development and deployment of AI technology. As consumers, we can expect to see more AI-powered innovations in the near future, making our digital experiences more personalized and intuitive than ever before.
