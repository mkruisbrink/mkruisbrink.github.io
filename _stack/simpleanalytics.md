## SimpleAnalytics Breakdown

Understanding the behaviour and interactions of your customer base is an extremely critical aspect of digital marketing. Thankfully, there are many tools specifically designed to help you achieve just that. When it comes to data collection and analysis, most business owners opt for Google Analytics as the default choice. However, with passing time, more analytical tools are emerging that offer a greater degree of privacy, insight, and marketing capacity. One of these is SimpleAnalytics.

I opted to use SimpleAnalytics for my website as an alternative to Google Analytics for a couple of reasons. This is why I chose it and how I use it:

## What is SimpleAnalytics?

SimpleAnalytics is an ethical, compliant, privacy focused tool based on EU servers that is designed to collect and analyse data in real time. The platform enables you to extract useful information from your visitors while respecting their privacy so you can work on growing your business.

### Simple User Interface

As suggested by the name of the tool, SimpleAnalytics keeps it down to the basics and offers a very straightforward and intuitive dashboard that is easy to navigate, even for complete newbies. That is why I definitely recommend this to those who are completely new to the world of data analytics as it can be quite confusing to delve into hundreds of features you have no idea how to use. It helps you remain focused on your primary analysis goals instead of getting distracted by unnecessary shenanigans. 

### Privacy First

SimpleAnalytics puts data privacy first and foremost, before everything. It operates on a cookieless basis, meaning your visitors' personal data is never stored. No IP addresses are tracked and no PII is stored- this also means you do not need to show those annoying cookie banners on your website. It complies with all privacy policies including but not limited to GDPR, PECR, and CCPA. you also get through data encryption on the servers at rest and in transit. 

### Data Ownership

This is another aspect where SimpleAnalytics goes above and beyond its competition. You get complete ownership of all of your data. The company does not sell the data to any third parties. Which means that all your raw data as well as analysis is completely protected, a point that customers appreciate as well. 

### Data Exporting

Not many data analysis tools let you export your data like SimpleAnalytics does. Since you completely own all of your data, you can export it directly from your dashboard as aggregated or raw data.

### Mobile Application

Unlike a lot of other analytics options, SimpleAnalytics also offers a mobile application to help you keep track of your performance remotely. You can add widgets to your home screen, interact with your dashboard, and monitor site performance as it happens in real time. The app allows you to clock self-visits to keep analysis clean. 

### Ample Integrations

SimpleAnalytics is able to integrate with a number of framework plugins and WordPress. It allows you to export your data very easily and create unique workflows to maximise functionality. If your favourite platform is not supported by the tool, you can get in touch with the developers and request them to make you a plugin!

### Support Materials

Since the tool keeps things fairly simple, the official documentation is easy to navigate and understand unlike most of its competitors. If you are unable to find the answers to your problem there, you can always contact the support team which is super helpful and quick to respond.

## SimpleAnalytics Pricing 

SimpleAnalytics offers three different plans that are best suited for businesses of different sizes:

### Starter 

The starter plan gives you 100,000 datapoints per month, support for 10 websites, and one user access with events and aggregated reports. It costs $19 per month. The annual plan costs $108 per year.

### Business 

The business kit includes everything in the starter kit plus raw-level export. You also get up to 1,000,000 datapoints per month, 10 users, and support for 100 websites. It will cost you $59 per month and $588 yearly. 

### Enterprise 

The enterprise tier includes everything in the business plan along with prio email support. You also receive over 1,000,000 datapoints per month with support for 10+ users and 100+ websites. This plan costs $99 per month.

## Alternatives to SimpleAnalytics

If you are looking for tools that offer similar functionality as Simpleanalytics, then consider checking out the following:

### Plausible Analytics

Plausible analytics is an open source, super lightweight tool that is available to use online. If you are concerned about data privacy, then this is the optimum choice as it gives you full data ownership. The dashboard is intuitive and full of features, including the ability to set goals. However, since it is an open source tool, there is a lack of documentation and customer support. 

### Google Analytics

Google Analytics is a widely popular tool that offers real time analytics to help you monitor sales and conversions. It also offers several advanced features, such as Advanced segmentation, to give you better insight into the interactions between your website/app and customers.

## Why Should You Use SimpleAnalytics?

SimpleAnalytics is definitely the best choice if you are concerned about the ethics of collecting and selling user data. It is a privacy-focused solution that allows you to collect and monitor the most critical parameters to learn about your customers and keep growing your business on the digital front. 

### Pros 

* Extremely easy to use and set up.
* Cookieless analytics give you more privacy. 
* Super responsive customer support team in case you run into any problems.

### Cons 

* The lack of cookies does compromise data collection and analysis to a certain degree. 
* Limited features as compared to other analytics platforms, although the privacy trade-off may be worth it.
