## Bonjoro Breakdown

Your digital marketing strategy is one of the most critical aspects of managing your business in the modern world. The internet and associated technologies allow you to access and engage new markets. Email marketing is one of the most commonly used methods of developing outreach and finding new leads for your business. However, the typical approach to email advertising is quickly becoming rather stale and ineffective. It doesn't matter how many emails you send out if the recipients are deleting them before they get to the second line!

In fact, this has become the reality for most online content. Over time, people’s expectations of the content they consume online have changed. You need to be able to engage your leads within the first few seconds of them arriving at your landing page. Visual and audio aids are a great way to grab a person’s attention. Personalizing such media significantly increases the chances of you retaining them! That is where tools like Bonjoro come in.

## What is Bonjoro?

Bonjoro is a platform designed to enhance customer engagement and help businesses convert leads into clients. The main attraction point of Bonjoro is the customization it offers. It integrates with existing email marketing platforms and allows brands to send engaging videos to their customers to reel them in and make them stay. It is a great way to build a very customer-focused brand which, in my opinion, is the best approach to take when it comes to developing a business or entrepreneurship in the contemporary industry. 

Here is an overview of some of the most pertinent features Bonjoro brings to the table:

### Video Hosting and Messaging

Of course, being a video hosting and sharing platform, this is Bonjoro’s main feature. But it truly is the best of its kind in the market right now. You can record videos on your desktop quickly with just a single click. Or you can upload your own pre-recorded videos to create your message. 

### Templates and Translations

The program has plenty of pre-made templates that you can use if you don't have the time to make your own. They are very professional and well-designed which is why I have used them on occasion as well. Additionally, Bonjoro has really great language support. You can translate your video content in over 20 different languages on the spot. If your desired language is not on the list, you can send in a request for it to be added in 24 hours!

### Communication Management

Bonjoro is great for team-based work environments which are very common in medium and large-scale businesses. You can set up team inboxes with select individuals to encourage communication and coordination within teams.

### Interactive Medium

Another thing I love about Bonjoro is that it is interactive- it actually allows the customers to answer back to you. So it is less like a brand sending a marketing email to a potential customer and more like a brand representative talking to and helping out a customer with their issues and queries. This makes a huge difference in how the user perceives and interacts with your brand and services.

### Easy Setup

The program is super easy to set up and the dashboard is minimalistic which makes it easy to use. You can even add it as a Chrome extension for quick access.

### Built-in Analytics 

The platform comes with built-in sales and marketing analytics along with a host of helpful tools. These serve to give you a better insight into the performance and impact of your video messages.

## Bonjoro Pricing

Bonjoro offers both free and paid versions of its platform. If you are a small startup, I recommend starting out with the free plan. You get up to 50 videos per month with unlimited text testimonials with one publishable. 

On the other hand, if you are a growing brand looking to capture customers with customized messages and videos, the paid plans are definitely worth looking into. Bonjoro has pretty simple pricing plans and I have found them to be quite reasonable considering how useful the program actually is:

### Starter Plan

The Starter plan costs you $19 per month and gives you access to features like custom branding, upto 25 video testimonials with 2 publishable, as well as Call-to-Action buttons on your videos for immediate engagement.

### Pro Plan

The Pro plan charges you $33 per month for an unlimited amount of video messages with 250 video testimonials and 3 testimonial publishables. You also get the additional ability to schedule your videos, which is important for large businesses.

### Grrrowth Plan

This is the most expensive Bonjoro plan at $69 per month and gives you access to even more features for better control at a larger scale. For example, this plan lets you make and send group video messages, set up your own custom domain, along with 10 testimonial publishables.

Each successive plan increases the limits on the features you are offered- more templates, more assets, more workflows, more cloud storage, etc. With any paid plan, you get a 14-day free trial. So if you just want to give it a test run before you commit to paying for it, go ahead! 

Bonjoro also supports team-based plans. For example, you can get a Company plan for $399 per month that supports 50 team members with unlimited features. 

## Alternatives to Bonjoro

If you would prefer to use an alternative, here are a few good options that are similar to Bonjoro:

### Dubb

Dubb is another popular video messaging platform. You can record, share, and then track your personalized video messages as you send them to customers as emails as well as SMS. The great thing about Dubb is that it can integrate with tools that you are probably already using like Chrome, Gmail, and ActiveCampaign, a tool I use for my mailing strategy. Compared to Bonjoro, Dubb definitely offers more integrations with relevant tools. However, I feel it is a less intuitive and efficient platform and tends to lean towards the more expensive side.

### Loom 

If you are looking for a cheaper option for your video messaging campaign that does not compromise too much on the quantity and quality of features you get, I would recommend Loom. In fact, even the free version of the program might suffice based on what your individual needs are. Aside from affordability, Loom’s main attractor is speed- it is probably one of the fastest video recording and processing platforms in the world of digital marketing. Setting up the program is super easy as well. You can download it or just add it as a Chrome extension for quick access. The biggest downside is that, unlike Bonjoro, Loom does not offer integrations with third party applications. 

## Why Should You Use Bonjoro?

All in all, Bonjoro has become a critical staple when it comes to building engagement on and for my website. It is an invaluable tool 

### Pros 
  
*	Super easy to set up and use.
*	Being able to add a personal touch to videos helps to immediately interest the customer and convince them to interact with the website/application. 
*	You can use the platform to record new videos or upload your own videos. 
*	Detailed previews give you an idea of what your message looks like before you send it to a lead.
*	Intuitive platform that gets easier to use the more you use it.
*	Compared to most other email marketing and video hosting platforms, the customer support is very engaging and helpful.

### Cons

*	The pricing plans are a bit rigid in terms of what features they offer. I think there should be a bit more flexibility on which features a user can access. Custom plans would be pretty great.
*	You may run into some technical issues on occasion. But, in my experience, they resolve pretty quickly. Customer support is helpful if your issues do persist.
