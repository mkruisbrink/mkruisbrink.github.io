## TimerCampaign Breakdown

Digital marketing has become a necessity in the modern business industry. However, as competition rises and customer expectations evolve, companies have to go above and beyond to modify their approach in order to retain visitorsâ€™ attention and convert leads into actual sales. Most websites use features like pop-ups, personalized video and audio content, and opt-in forms to make the consumer experience as unique as possible. 

One of the most effective ways of ensuring a high conversion rate is by using urgency to your advantage. Limited-time offers encourage visitors to respond positively to your calls to action. Whether it's merchandise for sale, a webinar, an event, or a simple sign-up list, adding a deadline creates a much greater impact which will translate into higher conversion. You can ramp up that impact ten-fold by adding an actual timer next to your offer that is a physical representation of the limited nature of the CTA. You can use simple tools like TimerCampaign to create and add countdowns to your web pages as I do for my website from time to time.

## What is TimerCampaign?

TimerCampaign is a tool that allows you to create *authenthic* countdown timers for different events, offers, and milestones on your website. You can choose your timezone and create original deadlines that end exactly when you want them to, achieving a desirable effect on your customers. The main reason I'm using TimerCampaign is because I can now

With a single subscription, you can generate as many countdowns, add as many milestones, and use as many dynamic texts as you would like.

Customer support at TimerCampaign is pretty helpful and responsive, which is great if you find yourself stuck at any stage in the process.

This subscription removes all restrictions so you get access to an unlimited number of campaigns, leads, data history, timers, and dynamic texts. You can cancel your plan whenever you want. You can also upgrade to the paid plan if you have already started working with the free version. You only need to provide your email address to sign up for a free account.

## Alternatives to TimerCampaign

Here are some options if you are looking for other tools like TimerCampaign:

### OptinMonster

OptinMonster is a pretty popular popup plugin for WordPress websites. Apart from adding opt-in forms and pages, it also allows you to add a timer feature to your website. It can also integrate a milestone countdown. You can choose from a popup timer to a widget on the side or as a floating bar. The builder uses a simple drag-and-drop mechanism which makes the process extremely easy and quick.

Countdown Timer Ultimate is a plugin that you download and use for free. It is a very basic tool but it gets the job done if you want to add a timer to your website.

You also have the option to choose the animation style, determine the specifications of the timer display, change colors and timer elements, and even set milestones.
