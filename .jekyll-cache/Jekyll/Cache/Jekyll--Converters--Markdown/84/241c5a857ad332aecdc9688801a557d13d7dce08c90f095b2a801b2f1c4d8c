I"Ü<p>Get to know a little about meâ€¦</p>

<h2 id="home">Home</h2>

<p>I currently live in the vibrant city of Rotterdam with my girlfriend. Rotterdam is a sprawling port-city and the views are absolutely amazing.</p>

<h2 id="travelling">Travelling</h2>

<p>Iâ€™ve traveled to 13 countries and lived in 6. Australia, New-Zealand, CuraÃ§ao, Kuwait, Costa-Rica being the most intense and amazing adventures, which were all over 5 months long. Australia and New-Zealand added up to a full year.</p>

<p>I practice Spanish every dayâ€¦ Having spent 6 months in Costa Rica helped a lot. I try to go to a Spanish speaking country often to practice and improve. The dream would be to make a roadtrip in South America.</p>

<h2 id="leisure">Leisure</h2>

<p>I have a huge collection of fantasy booksâ€¦ Not kidding, huge. My favorite writers so far are David Gemmel, Robert Jordan, Robin Hobb and Bernard Cornwell. Donâ€™t worry, I also read a lot of none-fantasy stuff tooâ€¦</p>

<p>I have a motorbike license but stil have to buy one and make that Europe tour. I would probably buy something like a Honda Shadow with Harley Davidson vibes.</p>

<h2 id="sports">Sports</h2>

<p>I try to go scuba-diving whenever I get the chance on a holiday or such. Iâ€™ve obtained all my licenses up to PADI Dive Master from periods abroad in Australia (Great Barrier Reef) and CuraÃ§ao. There is nothing quite like that feeling of floating around in the deep blue nothingness, 30+ meter underneath the surfaceâ€¦</p>

<p>Oh, and I also play tennis with my girlfriend but I do not have a cool picture (yet).</p>

<h2 id="knowledge">Knowledge</h2>
<p>After spending a few years traveling, working, gaming and trying to get clear what I actually wanted to do with my life, I decided to study civil engineering. After working in the industry for a short time, I quickly realised that I much preferred other things in life and went to pursue those.</p>
